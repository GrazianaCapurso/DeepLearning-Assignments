# DeepLearning-Assignments
1. From the Perceptron to DNN

Begin with grasping the concept of a simple perceptron and progress towards constructing a fundamental feedforward neural network for classifying digits using Python and NumPy.

3. Optimize and Train Deep Models
   
Craft a basic Deep Neural Network for tackling a classification task with PyTorch. Address issues like overfitting on the training set and conduct impartial model selection.

5. Convolutional Neural Networks
   
Craft a Convolutional Neural Network tailored for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

7. Recurrent Neural Networks & Transformer
   
Create a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset. Compare the computational load, parameter count, and performance of a basic RNN against more advanced models like LSTM and GRU. Additionally, explore the bidirectional model's efficacy. Finally, solve the sentiment analysis task using a Transformer to delve into its inner workings.

9. Autoencoders
    
Construct a simple shallow autoencoder for reducing dimensionality. Progress to a deeper version and experiment with applying autoencoders to denoising tasks.

11. Variational Autoencoders
    
Develop a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using core PyTorch components. Establish a training loop incorporating the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss essential for VAE training. Train the model on the MNIST dataset, tuning hyperparameters appropriately. Finally, analyze the learned latent encodings using various visualization methods.
